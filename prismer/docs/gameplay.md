# Resources
- Two kinds of Resources
    - Colors, and a special 'blank' color
    - Shapes (in particular; circles)

# Unit Descriptions 

- Circle:
    - resource gatherer
    - 'larva' for larger units
- Square
    - General soldier
- Lines?
    - If we let a circle morph into a number of lines
    - we could make resource highways

# The Game

The game with a single circle:

 / \ / \ / \ 
|   |   |   |
 \ /-\ / \ / 
  |-O-|   |  
 / \-/ \ / \ 
|   |   | r |
 \ / \ / \ / 

You can split into two:

 / \ / \ / \ 
|   |   |   |
 \ /-\ / \ / 
  |-O |   |  
 / \-/ \ / \ 
|   | O | r |
 \ / \ / \ / 

And the next turn:
- (1) split again
- (2) gather a resource

 / \ / \ / \ 
|   | O |   |
 \ / \ / \ / 
  |-O |   |  
 / \-/ \ / \ 
|   | Or|   |
 \ / \ / \ / 

- Now we morph into a square
- and give our resource to the middle guy

 / \ / \ / \ 
|   | + |   |
 \ / \ / \ / 
  | +r|   |  
 / \ / \ / \ 
|   | O |   |
 \ / \ / \ /
